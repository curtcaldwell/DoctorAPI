# _Doctor Lookup_

#### _A website where users may enter a medical issue (ie: “sore throat”, "rash", etc.) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of doctors in your city (Portland or Seattle depending on where you are) who can treat their medical issue_

#### By _**Curt Caldwell**_

## Specs

* _A user should be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query._
* _A user should be able to to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query._
* _If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data)._
* _If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is._
* _If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)_
